you can install types for react from the DefinitelyTyped repo. but we usually integrate ts through create react app (see documentation).
since we use react react app with ts, we don't need to use the 'tsc' command anymore. when we 'npm start', webpack does all the compilation, etc.

there's no official documentation to write React with TS, but this is a good reference:
