to look for the meaning of any option in the manual:
/[pattern]
(if you are looking for a word you can enter spaces before or after the word, so you will get the exact word)

(to look manual about the manual):
man man

(to specify the section you want to look for, eg. in this case, we want to look for the command passwd in section 1):
man 1 passwd

in Windows, the root directory is not the top directory (you have the C drive, etc.), but in true-unix or unix-like systems, the root directory is the top directory.

in root directory, we find the following folders:
bin: executable programs (eg. 'pwd'...)
etc: configuration files and initialization scripts (you can configure cron jobs, the nano text editor, etc.)
media: where we access removable media (usb drives, sd cards, dvds, cd roms, etc.)
var: files that have to do with login info (generated log files in the 'syslog' file), outputs of other programs, cashes, etc.
root (not to confuse with the top root directory): this is the home folder of the user called 'root'. if you are not the root or super user, you won't have persmission to access.
usr: different libraries, executable files, programs, if you install software, new commands, etc. it will end up in this folder.
